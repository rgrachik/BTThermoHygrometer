BME280 is a sensor that measures temperature, air pressure, and humidity. It is connected to the Arduino Nano via the I2C interface, which allows data to be transmitted between devices.

BT-18 is a Bluetooth module that provides wireless communication between the device and the iOS application. It allows data to be transmitted up to a distance of 10 meters.

SSD1306 128x64 is an OLED display that displays data on the screen. It is used to display measurements of temperature, pressure, and humidity.

Arduino Nano is the main control device that manages data collection, processing, and transmission to the BT-18 module and SSD1306 display.
